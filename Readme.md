## **1. Introduction**  
Vietnam is one of the leading coffee producers globally, and Atlantic Commodities Vietnam Ltd plays a crucial role in its coffee supply chain. This analysis aims to explore key challenges affecting coffee cultivation, including land problems, soil fertility, and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices.  

Leveraging data-driven insights, this report provides actionable recommendations to improve coffee farming sustainability.

## **2. Data Overview & Methodology**  
This study utilizes agricultural data from Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey 2016 (VARHS 2016), focusing on factors such as soil fertility, irrigation methods, and farming techniques. The analysis includes:  

- **Statistical modeling** to identify trends in land conditions.  
- **Comparative studies** to evaluate sustainable agricultural practices.  
- **Data visualization techniques** to highlight key patterns.  

Tools used for this analysis: MySQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Data Wrangler (for data cleaning), Stata (for statistical analysis), Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI (for visualization).

## **3. Key Findings & Insights**  

### **A. Land Problems & Soil Fertility**  
- **Dry land prevalence:** Dak Lak (61%) and Dak Nong (48%) experience significantly more dry land issues compared to Lam Dong (27%).  
- **Traditional vs. High-productivity plots:** Traditional coffee plots (64%) suffer more from dry land issues than high-productivity plots (40%).  
- **Impact of irrigation systems:** Plots lacking irrigation (79%) are far more likely to experience dry land conditions. Bore wells (24%) are more effective than other sources such as ponds, lakes, or rivers.  
- **Soil fertility concerns:** Traditional coffee plots show higher rates of declining fertility, particularly in Dak Nong and Lam Dong.  

### **B. Adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices**  
- **Adoption rate:** Nearly **70% of coffee plots** use at least one sustainability practice, but most rely solely on organic fertilizers.  
- **Regional differences:** Lam Dong leads in **Soil and Water Conservation (SWC)**, while Dak Lak and Dak Nong primarily focus on **Organic Fertilization (OF)**.  
- **Land slope impact:** Flat plots favor SWC, while sloped plots adopt OF more frequently.  
- **Water source effect:** Bore well access improves adoption of both SWC and OF compared to other water sources.  
- **Financial influence:** Plots used as mortgage collateral have higher SWC adoption but lower OF adoption.  
- **Sustainability benefits:** Plots practicing SWC and OF have **lower dry land rates** and **better soil fertility** over time.

## **4. Recommendations**

### **A. Addressing Dry Land Prevalence Through Water Management**
**Key Finding:** Dak Lak and Dak Nong experience significantly higher rates of dry land issues (61% and 48%, respectively), especially in traditional coffee plots. Lack of irrigation further exacerbates the problem.

- **Expand Bore Well Access _(with sustainable extraction measures)_**  
  Since plots relying on bore wells face fewer dry land issues than those using surface water, promoting bore well installation in Dak Lak and Dak Nong can mitigate drought effects. However, this must be coupled with **water recharge initiatives** to prevent aquifer depletion.  
  *Action:* Establish managed aquifer recharge systems, community rainwater harvesting, and precision irrigation strategies.

- **Encourage Water-Conserving Irrigation Methods _(to reduce dependency on groundwater)_**  
  Plots without irrigation face **higher dry land rates**. Introducing **drip irrigation** and **rainwater harvesting** will improve water use efficiency while preventing excessive groundwater extraction.  
  *Action:* Implement localized irrigation projects, offer farmer subsidies for installing drip systems, and train farmers on efficient water utilization.

### **B. Expanding Sustainable Agricultural Practices**
**Key Finding:** While 70% of coffee plots practice some form of sustainability, most rely solely on organic fertilization (OF), limiting long-term resilience.

- **Diversify Adoption Beyond Organic Fertilization _(to boost sustainability and soil recovery)_**  
  Since Lam Dong leads in **Soil and Water Conservation (SWC)** while Dak Lak and Dak Nong focus more on OF, farmers in Dak Lak and Dak Nong should be encouraged to incorporate **SWC** alongside organic fertilization.  
  *Action:* Provide incentives for SWC adoption in Dak Lak and Dak Nong, tailoring training to local land conditions.

---

### **C. Enhancing Soil Fertility for Long-Term Sustainability**
**Key Finding:** Traditional coffee plots face higher soil fertility decline, particularly in Dak Nong and Lam Dong.

- **Implement Soil Health Monitoring Programs _(to optimize soil fertility treatments)_**  
  With declining fertility rates linked to traditional farming methods, real-time monitoring programs will help track soil nutrient depletion and guide farmers on proper nutrient applications.  
  *Action:* Establish regional soil testing labs, develop farmer-accessible mobile apps for soil analysis, and encourage adoption of precision fertilization; Apply predictive modeling, machine learning, and remote sensing for scaling soil health monitoring

- **Encourage Crop Rotation & Intercropping _(to improve soil stability)_**  
  Since traditional coffee plots suffer more from fertility decline than high-productivity plots, diversifying crops will help restore soil balance.  
  *Action:* Provide financial incentives for rotating nitrogen-fixing crops alongside coffee.

### **D. Improving Financial Access for Sustainability Adoption**
**Key Finding:** Plots used as **mortgage collateral** have **higher SWC adoption rates but lower OF adoption**, suggesting financial constraints impact sustainability choices.

- **Develop Loan Programs for Farmers Adopting SWC & OF _(to balance financial pressure with sustainability)_**  
  Farmers who need loans to sustain their farms struggle to implement multiple sustainability strategies. Custom financing solutions should be available for both SWC and OF adoption.  
  *Action:* Introduce microfinance initiatives for soil conservation projects and provide grants for composting infrastructure.
